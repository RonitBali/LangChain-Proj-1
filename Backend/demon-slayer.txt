 official story of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.

In the snowy mountains of Taishō-era Japan, a kind-hearted boy named Tanjiro Kamado lived a simple but happy life with his mother and five younger siblings. He was the family's sole breadwinner after his father's death, often traveling to a nearby village to sell charcoal.

One cold winter day, Tanjiro makes his usual trip to the village. Because of the late hour and rumors of man-eating demons that lurk in the woods after dark, a villager insists he stay the night. Tanjiro agrees and heads home the next morning.

When he arrives, he is met with an unimaginable horror: his entire family has been brutally slaughtered. The only one still warm is his younger sister, Nezuko. Desperate to save her, he lifts her onto his back and races down the mountain, seeking a doctor.

On the frantic journey, Nezuko awakens, but she is not the same. She has been turned into a demon and viciously attacks Tanjiro. As they struggle, a figure appears—Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps.

Giyu intends to kill the newly-turned Nezuko, as is his duty. Tanjiro pleads for his sister's life, vowing to find a cure and protect her. In a moment of pure desperation, Tanjiro attacks the powerful Hashira to defend his sister.

Giyu is impressed by Tanjiro's raw courage. But what shocks him most is when Nezuko, despite her demonic hunger, moves to protect Tanjiro from Giyu's attack. Seeing this unusual display of humanity and willpower in a demon, Giyu decides to spare her.

He knocks them both out and places a bamboo muzzle on Nezuko's mouth as a precaution. When Tanjiro awakens, Giyu instructs him to seek out a man named Sakonji Urokodaki on Mount Sagiri. He tells Tanjiro to say that Giyu Tomioka sent him.

With this single thread of hope, Tanjiro's journey begins. He buries his family and sets off with Nezuko, now his sleeping, demonized companion. He is driven by a fierce new purpose: to hunt down the demon who murdered his family and, against all odds, find a way to turn his beloved sister back into a human.
